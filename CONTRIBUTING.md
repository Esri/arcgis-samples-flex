# Contributing to ArcGIS Flex API Samples

There are many ways you can contribute to the [ArcGIS Flex API Samples](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-samples-flex).

* Suggest enhancements on [forum](http://forums.arcgis.com/forums/18-ArcGIS-API-for-Flex) or as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-samples-flex/issues/).
* Report potential bugs to [Esri Support](http://support.esri.com/).
* Contribute code, as pull requests, to the ArcGIS Flex API samples.

This guide describes how you can contribute code improvements to the ArcGIS Flex API samples.

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [Flex API Samples repo](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-samples-flex/) on GitHub.
3. Clone it to your local machine.
4. Checkout the [develop branch](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-samples-flex/tree/develop).
5. Create a new feature branch on your local machine.
    * The name of the branch doesn't matter, but as a best practice use a descriptive name like "add-errorcheck-for-annotation-layers".
6. Write code to add an enhancement or fix the problem.
    * Follow the coding conventions already used in the samples (spaces instead of tabs, proper indentation, use [Flex Formatter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexformatter/files/) along with our [Flex Formatter settings](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-viewer-flex/blob/develop/FlexFormatter.properties)).
    * Document your code.
    * Make commits of logical units.
    * Use [clear and descriptive commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
7. Test your code.

### Submitting changes
1. Push the changes in your feature branch to your repo.
2. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) against the "develop" branch.  Submitting a pull request will open a GitHub issue.
    * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce; or if an enhancement, indicate the functionality you built.
